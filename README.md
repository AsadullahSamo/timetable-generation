# üóìÔ∏è Automated Timetable Generation System

A web-based, AI-powered class scheduling platform that automates the creation of conflict-free, optimized academic timetables. Built using **Next.js** and **Django REST**, the system leverages a custom **genetic algorithm** to generate schedules while adhering to over 18 real-world academic and infrastructure constraints.

## üöÄ Key Features

### üîÑ AI-Powered Timetable Generation

* Genetic algorithm-based optimization
* Real-time generation with progress tracking
* Generates compact, practical, and conflict-free schedules

### üìã Comprehensive Constraint Management

* Handles academic, infrastructure, and institutional rules
* Avoids common conflicts like teacher overlaps or double-booked rooms
* Ensures practical classes are in labs, with consistent room usage

### üß† Intelligent Scheduling Logic

* Smart teacher-subject matching
* Friday-aware scheduling (early dismissal rules)
* Reserved thesis days for final-year students
* Distribution of sessions across all weekdays

### üè´ Room & Lab Allocation

* Enforces ‚Äúsame-lab‚Äù rule for practical blocks
* Guarantees no room overlap and lab-only allocation for practicals
* Adaptive assignment for senior batches with flexible lab preferences

### üîê User Management & Auth

* Firebase Authentication integration
* Multi-user access for administrators, faculty, and staff

### üì§ Export & Accessibility

* Export generated timetables in multiple formats (PDF, Excel, etc.)
* Mobile-friendly, responsive UI for on-the-go access

## ‚öôÔ∏è Constraint Highlights

> The system currently respects **18+ academic and room constraints**, including:

#### Academic & Scheduling

1. Subject-wise frequency per week (based on credit hours)
2. 3-hour practical blocks (auto-grouped)
3. No duplicate theory classes of the same subject per day
4. Minimum number of classes per day enforced
5. Thesis scheduling on Wednesdays (final year only)
6. Intelligent subject-teacher mapping
7. Avoids scheduling classes beyond institutional working hours (8AM‚Äì3PM)

#### Room Allocation

8. No room overlaps or double-bookings
9. Same-lab rule for practical subjects
10. Practical subjects scheduled **only** in lab rooms
11. Room consistency for theory classes
12. Flexible room usage for senior batches (labs preferred)

#### Conflict Prevention

13. No teacher overlaps across classes
14. Cross-semester conflict detection
15. Section-level conflict prevention
16. Friday constraints (earlier cutoff for classes)
17. Compact and student-friendly scheduling
18. Balanced subject distribution throughout the week

‚úÖ All constraints have been successfully implemented and tested in real-time use cases.
