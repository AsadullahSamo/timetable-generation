# üóìÔ∏è Automated Timetable G### üè´ Room & Lab Allocation

* Enforces "same-lab" rule for practical blocks
* Guarantees no room overlap and lab-only allocation for practicals
* Enhanced room consistency for theory/practical separationtion System

A web-based class scheduling platform that automates the creation of conflict-free, optimized academic timetables. Built using **Next.js** and **Django REST Framework**, the system leverages a custom constraint-based algorithm to generate schedules while adhering to 19 real-world academic and infrastructure constraints.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Constraint Highlights

> The system respects **19 academic and room constraints**, including:

#### Academic & Scheduling

1. Subject Frequency - Correct number of classes per week based on credit hours
2. Practical Blocks - 3-hour consecutive blocks for practical subjects
3. No Duplicate Theory Per Day - No section can have multiple theory classes of the same subject on the same day
4. Minimum Daily Classes - No day has only practical or only one class
5. Thesis Day - Wednesday is exclusively reserved for Thesis subjects for final year students
6. Intelligent Teacher Assignment - Matches teachers to their assigned subjects
7. Working Hours - All classes are within 8:00 AM to 3:00 PM
8. Same Theory Subject Distribution - Max 1 class per day, distributed across 5 weekdays
9. Teacher Unavailability - Teachers cannot be scheduled during their unavailable periods (hard constraint)

#### Room Allocation

10. No Room Conflicts - Rooms cannot be double-booked
11. Same Lab Rule - All 3 blocks of practical subjects must use the same lab
12. Practicals in Labs - Practical subjects must be scheduled only in laboratory rooms
13. Room Consistency - Consistent room assignment for theory classes per section

#### Conflict Prevention

14. No Teacher Overlap - Teachers cannot be in multiple places at once
15. Cross-Semester Conflict Detection - Prevents scheduling conflicts across batches
16. Section Conflicts - Prevents multiple simultaneous classes for same section
17. Friday Time Limits - Classes must not exceed 12:00/1:00 PM with practical, 11:00 AM without practical
18. Compact Scheduling - Classes wrap up quickly while respecting Friday constraints
19. Appropriate Distribution - Classes are spread across all 5 days

‚úÖ All constraints have been successfully implemented and tested in real-time use cases.
