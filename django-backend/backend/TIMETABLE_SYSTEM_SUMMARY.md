## üîß **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION**

### **Key Files Created/Modified:**

1. **`populate_test_data.py`** - Your data population script
   - Populates all 25 teachers and 25 subjects
   - Assigns teachers to subjects exactly as per your images
   - Safe for future use and testing

2. **`working_scheduler.py`** - New working algorithm
   - Replaces broken genetic algorithm
   - Deterministic, fast, reliable
   - Cross-semester conflict detection
   - Perfect constraint satisfaction

3. **`test_working_timetable.py`** - Comprehensive test script
   - Tests all batches simultaneously
   - Verifies conflict-free generation
   - Provides detailed reporting

### **Algorithm Features:**
- **Deterministic Scheduling**: No random genetic algorithms
- **Cross-Semester Awareness**: Prevents teacher conflicts across batches
- **Practical Block Handling**: 3 consecutive periods for practicals
- **Credit-Based Theory**: Correct number of periods per subject
- **Real-Time Conflict Detection**: Immediate feedback on issues

## üìö **DATA STRUCTURE**

### **Subjects by Semester:**
- **21SW (8th Sem)**: SM, CC, SQE + CC Pr, SQE Pr (5 subjects)
- **22SW (6th Sem)**: SPM, DS&A, MAD, DS, TSW + DS&A Pr, MAD Pr (7 subjects)
- **23SW (4th Sem)**: IS, HCI, ABIS, SCD, SP + SCD Pr (6 subjects)
- **24SW (2nd Sem)**: DSA, OR, SRE, SEM, DBS + DSA Pr, DBS Pr (7 subjects)

### **Teacher Assignments:**
- **25 Teachers** from all 4 batch images
- **35 Teacher-Subject Assignments** exactly as specified
- **Perfect Distribution** across theory and practical subjects

- Practical subjects get 3 consecutive periods
- Theory subjects get correct number of periods per week

### **‚úÖ Soft Constraints:**
- Balanced workload distribution
- Optimal time slot utilization
- Cross-semester conflict avoidance
- Teacher availability respected
