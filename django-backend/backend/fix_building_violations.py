Script to fix existing timetable entries that violate building rules.
This script will:
1. Find all timetable entries that violate building rules
2. Move them to the correct buildings automatically
3. Ensure 2nd year batches use Academic Building for theory classes
4. Ensure non-2nd year batches use Main Building for theory classes
