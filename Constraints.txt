ðŸ“‹ Current Constraints Respected by the Algorithm
Here are all the constraints currently implemented and working:

âœ… Subject Frequency - Correct number of classes per week based on credits
âœ… Practical Blocks - 3-hour consecutive blocks for practical subjects
âœ… No Teacher Overlap - Teachers cannot be in multiple places at once
âœ… No Room Conflicts - Rooms cannot be double-booked
âœ… Cross-Semester Conflict Detection - Prevents scheduling conflicts across batches
âœ… Intelligent Teacher Assignment - Matches teachers to their assigned subjects
âœ… Friday Time Limits - Classes must not exceed 12:00/1:00 PM with practical, 11:00 AM without practical
âœ… Minimum Daily Classes - No day has only practical or only one class
âœ… Compact Scheduling - Classes wrap up quickly while respecting Friday constraints
âœ… Friday-Aware Scheduling - Monday-Thursday scheduling considers Friday limits proactively
âœ… Thesis Day Constraint - Wednesday is exclusively reserved for Thesis subjects for final year students




âœ… Enhanced Room & Lab Allocation - Practical subjects MUST be in labs with same-lab rule enforcement
âœ… Universal Lab Consistency - All 3 blocks of practical subjects use the same lab (strict enforcement)
âœ… Flexible Senior Batch Allocation - Senior batches prefer labs but can use regular rooms when needed for practicals

To be implemented:
1. There can't be more than one theory class (3 or 2) credit hours) on a given day (while also respecting "Subject Frequency" based on credit hours, for a week with exception of practical)
