ðŸ“‹ Current Constraints Respected by the Algorithm
Here are all the constraints currently implemented and working:

âœ… Subject Frequency - Correct number of classes per week based on credits
âœ… Practical Blocks - 3-hour consecutive blocks for practical subjects
âœ… No Teacher Overlap - Teachers cannot be in multiple places at once
âœ… No Room Conflicts - Rooms cannot be double-booked
âœ… Cross-Semester Conflict Detection - Prevents scheduling conflicts across batches
âœ… Intelligent Teacher Assignment - Matches teachers to their assigned subjects
âœ… Friday Time Limits - Classes must not exceed 12:00/1:00 PM with practical, 11:00 AM without practical
âœ… Minimum Daily Classes - No day has only practical or only one class
âœ… Compact Scheduling - Classes wrap up quickly while respecting Friday constraints
âœ… Friday-Aware Scheduling - Monday-Thursday scheduling considers Friday limits proactively


2. Thesis Day: Should be determined by Subject "Thesis" and should be scheduled on Wednesday for all sections of that batch (having Thesis subject) and on that day "Wednesday" there must not be any other subjects
3. There can't be more than one theory class (3 or 2) credit hours) on a given day (while also respecting "Subject Frequency" based on credit hours, for a week with exception of practical)
