ðŸ“‹ Current Constraints Respected by the Algorithm
Here are all the constraints currently implemented and working:

1.  Subject Frequency - Correct number of classes per week based on credits
2.  Practical Blocks - 3-hour consecutive blocks for practical subjects
3.  No Teacher Overlap - Teachers cannot be in multiple places at once
4.  No Room Conflicts - Rooms cannot be double-booked
5.  Cross-Semester Conflict Detection - Prevents scheduling conflicts across batches
6.  Intelligent Teacher Assignment - Matches teachers to their assigned subjects
7.  Friday Time Limits - Classes must not exceed 12:00/1:00 PM with practical, 11:00 AM without practical
8.  Minimum Daily Classes - No day has only practical or only one class
9.  Compact Scheduling - Classes wrap up quickly while respecting Friday constraints
10. Friday-Aware Scheduling - Monday-Thursday scheduling considers Friday limits proactively
11. Working Hours  - All classes are within 8:00 AM to 3:00 PM
12. Thesis Day - Wednesday is exclusively reserved for Thesis subjects for final year students
13. Max Theory per Day - Maximum one theory class per day per section
14. Same Lab Rule - All 3 blocks of practical subjects must use the same lab
15. Practicals in Labs - Practical subjects must be scheduled only in laboratory rooms
16. Appropriate Distribution - Lessons are spread across all 5 days
17. Room Consistency - Consistent room assignment for theory classes per section
18. Section Conflicts - Prevents multiple simultaneous classes for same section





âœ… Enhanced Room & Lab Allocation - Practical subjects MUST be in labs with same-lab rule enforcement
âœ… Universal Lab Consistency - All 3 blocks of practical subjects use the same lab (strict enforcement)
âœ… Flexible Senior Batch Allocation - Senior batches prefer labs but can use regular rooms when needed for practicals

To be implemented:
1. There can't be more than one theory class (3 or 2) credit hours) on a given day (while also respecting "Subject Frequency" based on credit hours, for a week with exception of practical)
